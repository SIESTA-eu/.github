Welcome to the [EOSC-SIESTA](https://eosc-siesta.eu) project organization in GitHub.

## What is EOSC-SIESTA

The SIESTA project aims to provide a set of tools, services, and methodologies
for the effective sharing of sensitive data in the EOSC, following a
cloud-based model and approach. SIESTA will provide user-friendly tools with
the aim of fostering the uptake of sensitive data sharing and processing in the
EOSC. The project will deliver trusted cloud-based environments for the
management and sharing of sensitive data that are built in a reproducible way,
together with a set of services and tools to ease the secure sharing of
sensitive data in the EOSC through state-of-the-art anonymization techniques.
The overall objective is to enhance the EOSC Exchange services by delivering a
set of cloud-based trusted environments for the analysis of sensitive data in
the EOSC demonstrating the feasibility of the FAIR principles over them.
